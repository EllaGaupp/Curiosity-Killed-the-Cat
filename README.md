## Description

This is a text-based, choose your own adventure, mystery game. It centers around
the player being a monster hunter an noticing other monster hunters going missing. 
The player then decides to investigate the matter, which leads them to a small,
secluded town.

While at the town, the player is able to investigate one of three options per day.
Either the Apothecary, the Lumberjack, or the Night Guard is up for inspection.

The first night is noted at a full moon. If the player were to choose the 
Lumberjack on the second day and choose to continue investigating him, 
they'd find themselves in a battle with a werewolf.

The battle mechanics is a randomized chance to hit or miss. Each monster
has it's own hit rate, damamage, and hit points. The player must choose 
the correct weapon for the correlating monster to have a chance to win.
If they don't choose the right weapon they instantly lose. If the player
and the monster were to both go down to 0 hit points in the same turn,
the player would get a sudden burst of energy and win. 

The witch, vampire, and non-full moon interactions are similar.
The player is able to ask questions and make observations.
At the end an item is added to their bag as evidence. At the
end of each day the player is offered the option to check
their bag and review what they've collected. On the 
fifth day the player is able to leave the town or select 
someone to accuse and hunt. 

Upon leaving the player survives and later hears about the truth 
of the town.

Choosing to battle the vampire or werewolf and losing would
result in the player being turned into the respective monster.
However, if the player were to lose to the witch, she would
turn the player into a frog thats implied to be used as ingredients 
for her potions.
